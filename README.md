### Group Project

We titled our game, which is about a samurai who takes on the world, Purple Man Fights Back.

It is a side-scrolling platformer with gravity and enemies. We spent over a month working on our game and started from a simple class diagram.

### Poem Generator

When asked to create a program exhibiting inheritence, I took the novel approach of creating a poem generator. It takes some user input, mixed with some random word generation, and outputs a refrigerator magnet style poem.
