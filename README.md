## Group Project

For the end of semester group project, we created a side-scrolling platformer about a purple samurai who takes on the world.

It is a side-scrolling platformer with gravity and enemies which we spent over a month working on it. I coded the entire game, mostly focusing on creating a physics environment, and enemy and platform classes which can be called easily.

## Poem Generator

When asked to code a program exhibiting class inheritance, I chose the novel route of writing a poem generator. My program prompts the user for input, and then takes the inputted words, along with a few randomly selected words, to write a poem similar to those you can create out of magnets on the side of your fridge. There are three modes: free verse, rhyming couplet, and sentence form.
