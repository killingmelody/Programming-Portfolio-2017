# Semester 2 of Skyline HS Programming 1

## Group Project

For the end of semester group project, my programming group created a side-scrolling platformer about a purple samurai who takes on the world.

We spent over a month working on this game with gravity and enemies. I coded the entire game (1,137 lines!), mostly focusing on creating a physics environment, and enemy and platform classes which can be called easily. We used the Processing.py coding environment, and it was the biggest coding challenge of the year as it required researching many concepts I was unfamiliar with.

## Poem Generator

When asked to code a program exhibiting class inheritance, I chose the novel route of writing a poem generator. My program prompts the user for input, and then takes the inputted words, along with a few randomly selected words, to write a poem similar to those you can create out of magnets on the side of your fridge. There are three modes: free verse, rhyming couplet, and sentence form.

## DNA Mutation Simulation

In my free time between projects, I created a small applet which lets users explore how strings of DNA mutate, with possibilites such as a duplication mutation and base-pair insertion possible. The user chooses how long to run the program, and it outputs the resultant string of DNA at the end.

## Number Puzzle

Another applet I created for fun outside of class was this small number puzzle program. It generates a string of four numbers, scrambles it, then prints the numbers is ascending order along with some hints to the scrambled order. The user then has to enter the correct order which the numbers were rearranged in.

## Pig Latin Converter

During the semester, when exploring string manipulation in Python, we were tasked with creating a converter program which took a user inputted name and re-arranged it into pig-latin using string concatenation.

## Age Calculator

One of our assignments was to create a program where a user-inputted birthday is processed through an algorithm which calculates their current age as a combination of years, months and days. This age calculator tested our ability to create case statements.

## Dice Simulator

To test our ability with arrays, we were challenged to create a simulator for dice rolls. My adaptation of the program allows the user to input number of faces and rolls, resulting in a list of generated values as well as diagnostic information regarding the simulation.

## 99 Bottles Program

This is a classic program testing basic comprehension of looping. This was our first coding assignment for the semester, and although simple, it taught me the basics of the Python language.
